======
Facial expressions (whether natural or forced) can have a [major impact on your mood](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/18/science/a-feel-good-theory-a-smile-affects-mood.html), according to several research studies. And the positive effects of smiling are also [well documented](http://www.fastcompany.com/3041438/how-to-be-a-success-at-everything/how-smiling-changes-your-brain). Meanwhile, we all know certain "types" of sites put our [mental health at risk](http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.2014.33.8.701).

So, I built a Chrome Extension (based on Arduno's [clmtrackr library](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr)) to help you *StayHappy* while you browse certain types of sites
